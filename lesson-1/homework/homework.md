# Project 1: Sales Performance Dashboard

Objective: Create a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into the sales performance of a company. The dashboard should include visualizations, data transformations, and formatting, ensuring it is user-friendly and interactive.

Project Instructions:

1.Data Import:
-Use an Excel or CSV dataset that includes the following columns:
Date,Product Name,Sales Amount,Salesperson,Region Units Sold

-Import this data into Power BI and clean it (e.g., remove duplicates,handle missing values).
2.Data Transformation:
-In Power Query, transform the data:
Split the "Date" column into separate "Year" and "Month" columns.

-Merge "First Name" and "Last Name" columns if the dataset contains separate fields for salespeople's names.

-Apply necessary transformations to ensure consistency.
3.Data Modeling:
-Create relationships between tables (if applicable). For example, if you have separate tables for Products, Salespeople, or Regions, link them using common keys.

-Create a calculated column to show Total Sales (e.g., Units Sold * Sales Amount).

-Create a measure to calculate the Average Sales Price.
4.Visualization:
Build the following visuals:
- Bar Chart to show total sales per product.
- Line Chart to display monthly sales trends.
-Pie Chart or Donut Chart to show sales distribution by region.
-Table that shows the sales performance by salesperson with
conditional  formatting to highlight top and bottom performers.
-Add slicers for filtering by region, salesperson, or year.

5.Final Output:
Your final dashboard should provide clear insights into:
-Overall sales performance.
-Top-selling products and regions.
-Monthly sales trends.
-Sales performance by salesperson.
